# Blocking-DNS-Attacks-Using-Blockchain--Based-Domain-Name-System-
The Internet is an essential part of modern life, but it's also a prime target for cybercriminals who 
use tactics to steal sensitive information. Despite efforts to secure websites with Transport Layer 
Security (TLS) certificates, vulnerabilities such as DNS spoofing and cache poisoning persist, 
exposing users to risks like phishing and man-in-the-middle attacks. Traditional defenses like IP 
whitelisting and DNS filtering have limitations, often failing to address sophisticated forms of 
attacks, prompting the exploration of innovative solutions. In response, we propose a novel 
approach that harnesses blockchain technology to verify website authenticity in a decentralized 
manner. By storing website details, including domain name and associated records, in a 
blockchain using smart contracts, we create an immutable record that cannot be tampered with 
by attackers. This decentralized ledger ensures that once a websiteâ€™s information is verified and 
stored, it remains secure, offering a trustless environment where no single authority can alter the 
data. DNS queries are managed through smart contracts, which oversee domain-to-IP mapping, 
ensuring that users are directed to the correct server and preventing URL redirection attacks, thus 
maintaining the integrity of website verification. Furthermore, our approach significantly 
mitigates the risks of DNS cache poisoning by removing the reliance on centralized DNS 
servers, which are vulnerable to compromise. Leveraging the inherent security features of 
blockchain, such as transparency, decentralization, and cryptographic integrity, our method 
effectively identifies phishing websites and other malicious activities without adding complexity 
for users. This ensures a more seamless and secure browsing experience.
